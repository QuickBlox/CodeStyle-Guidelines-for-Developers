# HTML

* Omit type attributes for style sheets and scripts. Do not use type attributes for style sheets and scripts;
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//styles.css">
<script src="//behavior.js"></script>
```
* Always define which language the page is written in. *A  list of [language codes](http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/lang-codes)*;
* Always include an alt attribute for images;
* Use a new line for every block element, list, or table element, and indent every such child element;
```html
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Space</em>, the final frontier.</p>
</blockquote>
```
* Use double ("") rather than single quotation marks ('') around attribute values;
