# Web-team coding style

### General principles
Don't try to prematurely optimize your code, keep it readable and understandable. All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, even when many people are contributing to it. Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style. If in doubt when deciding upon a style use existing, common patterns.

### General
* **Unix-style linebreaks** ``('\n')``, not Windows-style ``('\r\n')``;
* Use **UTF-8(without BOM)** as character encoding, without a byte order mark;
* Preferred line length is **80 characters**;
* Use **soft tabs** with **four (4) spaces**, no tabs, no whitespace at the end of a line;
* Always keep markup, styling, and scripting separate.

### Editor preferences
* Set encoding to UTF-8(without BOM);
* Use soft-tabs set to 4 spaces;
* Add new line at end of files;
* Trim trailing white space on save;
